How to Use Excel 2000
to solve for quadratic polynomial coefficients
for minimum max absolute error 
with constrained endpoints


fill cells C1..C46 with 0, 1, 2, ... 45


in cell B1, type this formula:
=TAN(C1/180*PI())
... and then copy it down to cell B46


find a trendline equation:
- highlight cells B1..C46 and plot an XY "scatter graph"
- right-click on the curve and select "add trendline"
  from the context menu
- select polynomial order 2
- select options "display equation on chart"
- click "OK"


- TYPE THE 3 COEFFICIENTS OF THE TRENDLINE EQUATION
  INTO CELLS  A1, A2, and A3.  (These act as the
  starting "seed" value for the Solver in the last step) 


in cell D1, type this formula:
=B1*($A$1*B1+$A$2)+$A$3
... and then copy it down to cell D46


in cell E1, type this formula:
=ABS(D1-C1)
... and then copy it down to cell E46


in cell A5, type this formula:
=MAX(E1:E46)


click Tools|Solver and:
- set target cell $A$5
- Equal to "Min"
- By Changing Cells $A$1:$A$3
- Subject to Constraints
  $E$1 <= 0.005
  $E$46 <= 0.005
- Options Conjugate
- click "Solve"
- click Keep Solver Solution


The Solver finds a “local” minimum. 
Try changing the “seed” values in cells
A1,A2,A3 slightly and re-run Solver
to try to find the solution which
gives the smallest error.
